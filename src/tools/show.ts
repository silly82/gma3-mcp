 * SU-20: save the show (SETUP.md SU-20, docs/probes/su-20-save-show-macos-2.5.1.md).
 *
 *   gma3_show_files   read-only: the current show, the shows folder and its .show files (size, time)
 *   gma3_save_show    saves under the current name or a new one; refuses to overwrite another show's file unless
 *                     overwrite: true; answers SaveShow's own confirmation; reports the file written (size, time)
 *   gma3_load_show    loads a show from the shows folder, answers the unsaved-changes question as asked, and restarts
 *                     the bridge the load unloaded (OSC); verified by the new bridge naming the show
 *                     (docs/probes/load-show-macos-2.5.1.md)
 *
 * Bridge ops show.files / show.save / show.answer (0.35.0). Console facts (onPC 2.5.1, live 2026-10-16):
 *   - SaveShow is sent with CmdIndirect: a dialog opened from the plugin thread would stall the bridge.
 *   - Under the current name it writes at once, with no dialog.
 *   - Under a new name it asks "Change show file name?" (OK / Cancel); under the name of another existing file it asks
 *     "Change show file name and overwrite existing show file?". OK writes at once and makes that name current.
 *   - DirList reports the local wall-clock time as if it were UTC; the bridge corrects it (time) and keeps the
 *     wall-clock text (localTime).
